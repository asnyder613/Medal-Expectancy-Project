# Medal-Expectancy-Project
WIST Fellow Summer 2023 Project

A project to analyze the optimal simulations of a monte carlo program used to predict the medal expectancy of athletes for the next Olympic games. Analysis was made using R in order to determine the number of simulations which would maximize accuracy while also minimizing runtime.
